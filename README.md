# Andhrímnir

**Andhrímnir** is a proposed AI incident-intelligence platform for restaurant operations. The GitHub repository is named **DineSmart**. The platform turns signals from orders, reservations, inventory, kitchen workflows, and staff activity into incidents, contextual recommendations, and operational insights for restaurant teams.

> This repository contains the product and technical documentation, a documentation-conversion utility, and the initial Next.js frontend shell. Product workflows and the backend have not yet been implemented.

## Product vision

Most restaurant systems record transactions but do not proactively identify operational issues. Andhrímnir is designed as an intelligence layer that helps teams detect bottlenecks, shortages, delays, and congestion before they affect customers.

The documented MVP scope includes:

- Customer authentication, digital menu, reservations, and orders
- Restaurant operations dashboard, kitchen queue, and inventory monitoring
- Rule-based incident detection and explainable AI-assisted recommendations
- Restaurant health score, analytics, notifications, and role-based access

## Planned architecture

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js `16.4.0` App Router, React `19.3.0`, Tailwind CSS `4.3.3`, TypeScript, Biome `2.5.15` |
| Backend | Node.js `24.21.0` LTS, Express.js REST APIs, TypeScript |
| Data | MongoDB Atlas |
| Authentication | Email/OTP registration, Email/Password login, Google OAuth, JWT, RBAC |
| AI | Gemini API |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend), Render (backend) |

Node.js `24.21.0` is pinned in the repository-root `.nvmrc`. The frontend dependency lockfile is authoritative for resolved package versions.

## Frontend setup

From the repository root, use Node.js `24.21.0` and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The `/` route is a neutral application shell only; it does not yet implement customer or restaurant workflows or call a backend. See the [frontend guide](frontend/README.md) for the lint, format, typecheck, and build commands.

## Continuous integration

The [GitHub Actions CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatch. It installs from the lockfile, audits dependencies, checks Biome and TypeScript, and builds the frontend. The test step runs when a test script is configured; backend checks activate once the backend package exists. This adds CI only—deployment/CD is not configured.

## Development status

The MVP scope, architecture, API endpoint inventory, delivery plan, and test criteria are documented. The S1-03 Next.js foundation is locally validated on `feature/S1-03-nextjs-setup` and **Ready to Push**. Initial frontend CI is added on `feature/S1-07-ci-cd`; S1-07 remains **In Progress** pending backend/test coverage and deployment decisions. No remote push has been made. The shell is not a product workflow: the Express backend, integrations, and automated feature tests remain pending. Track task status in the [canonical sprint backlog](Docs/Planning/Andhrimnir_Sprint_Backlog.md). The [Implementation Decisions](Docs/Architecture/Andhrimnir_Implementation_Decisions.md) document records approved defaults and open module-specific decisions.
